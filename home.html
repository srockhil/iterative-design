            <p>In this project I've set out to learn how A/B testing can tell us the effects our interface changes have
            on the performance of our applications. To do this, I used the simple example of a website selling cacti.
            Users were to add at least $150 worth of cacti to the cart and checkout. I decided to measure both time to
            completion of the task, and the rate at which users returned to the home page from the cart. I created two
            versions of the website to see their effect on these metrics, these two versions are shown below. Upon
            visiting the site, users would be randomly taken to site A or B. Click the link below to get one of these
            sites at random!</p>
            <h3 id="interfaces">The Two Interfaces</h3>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col">
                <h4>Site A</h4>
                <p>This version has the "Add To Cart" buttons to the right of the image along with "# in cart" wording
                to display the quantity. The different cacti are also lacking titles.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/site_a.png" alt="Site A">
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <h4>Site B</h4>
                <p>In this version the "Add To Cart" button is placed below the cacti, with "Quantity: " used as the
                language to show quantity. There are also new titles above each type of cacti, specifying the type.</p>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/site_b.png" alt="Site B">

            <h2 id="hypothesis" class="text-center">Hypotheses</h2>
            <p>Before setting out to collect and analyze data, I wrote null hypothesis for each of my metrics. Our data
            will let us know if we have disproven the null hypothesis and should therefore accept the alternative
            hypothesis.</p>
            <h3 id="completion">Time to Completion</h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 400 !important;"><b>Null Hypothesis: </b>Interface B has no faster time to completion than interface A.</h4>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 400 !important;"><b>Alternative Hypothesis: </b>Interface B has a faster time to completion than interface A.</h4>
            <h4 class="text-center">Reasoning</h4>
            <p>I think the added titles in site B, as well as the more easily stacked buttons, will make it easier to
            quickly navigate site B, giving it a slight edge for time to completion.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h3 id="return">Return Rate</h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 400 !important;"><b>Null Hypothesis: </b>Interface B has no lower return rate than interface A.</h4>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 400 !important;"><b>Alternative Hypothesis: </b>Interface B has a lower return rate than interface A.</h4>
            <h4 class="text-center">Reasoning</h4>
            <p>I think the wording of "Quantity: " in interface B is less confusing and will help users be more
            successful when adding items to their cart, and therefore will need to return from the cart less.</p>

            <h2 id="collecting-data" class="text-center">Collecting Data</h2>
            <p>Data was collected from 20 different users of the website. This data was stored in timed logs that
            allowed me to see when users loaded each site, added items to the cart, viewed the cart, and returned to the
            page. Using these logs I was then able to aggregate the data, analyze it, and come up with my conclusions.
              An example of these logs is below. </p>

            <h2 id="results" class="text-center">Results Infographic</h2>
            <p>Using the data from above I calculated the T-Score and P-Value of the time to completion and the Chi^2
            and P-Value for the return rate of both versions (A & B) of the site. I summarized these results and
            findings in the infographic below. For there to be a significant difference we were looking for a P-Value
            less than 0.05. Therefore, for both time to completion and return rate, I did not find a significant
            difference between sites A and B and therefore kept my null hypotheses.</p>

            <p>In the end, I've concluded the following from doing this project:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I definitely needed more users and was limited by having only 20. Had I had more users I think I may
               have been able to conclude that there was a difference between the two interfaces.</li>
              <li>I also feel we were limited in this assignment as our users were simply other user interface students,
              meaning our results are fairly biased.</li>
              <li>Although I wasn't able to come to an actual conclusion, Site B did average a shorter time to
              completion which I do believe shows that that layout with titles and buttons creating more of a clear
                grouping or card affordance was more intuitive to quickly use.</li>
            </ul>
